# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Car Price Prediction** project!  
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the selling price of used cars based on features like car brand, manufacturing year, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc. The dataset is sourced from **CarDekho**.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
📁 Car Price Prediction
️
🔹 CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv               # Main dataset
🔹 CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO 1.csv             # Additional/cleaned dataset
🔹 CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO sample.csv        # Sample for testing

🔹 ML WORK.py                                   # Model training and EDA
🔹 Carpricemodel.py                             # Streamlined script for model
🔹 new.py, newdataset.py                        # Experimentation scripts

🔹 car_price_prediction_model.pkl               # Final trained model
🔹 linear_regression_model.pkl                  # Linear regression model

🔹 pyvenv.cfg                                   # Virtual environment config

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install the required packages  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run `Carpricemodel.py` or `ML WORK.py` to train the model  
4. Use the `.pkl` file for predictions in a web app or API
